        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>This is site is going to contain information and content<br>
        relevant to the websites and projects from class.</p>
        <h3>List of Portfolio Projects</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Wordpress site from Javascript class. A basic site with parralex
          effects, links to some Javascript apps created during the class and one
        or two I made on my own.</li>
          <li>Site from PHP/MySQL class. A site built with bootstrap that was converted
            into a Wordpress theme. The site allows for logins, uploads, comments,blog entries,
            has a gallery, and a side bar with search, recent posts, recent comments,
          archives, categorioes.</li>
          <li>Another entry I hope will be a game I am making in Javascript. It's a pretty
          simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game that can be played vs the computer or vs
          another player. It's really a stepping stone project. I'm hoping that I can roll over
          some of the tricks into a more complicated game like blackjack at some point. But it will
          show some degree of proficiency with Javascript and coding in general.</li>
          <li>Time premitting I want to put up an actual site for a actual business. I work part
            time at a tattoo shop and the site needs a serious overhaul. If I can get to it I'm
            hoping to put together a professional site.</li>
            <li> And I'll be putting up the final from this class as well.</li>
        </ol>
